The dataset is about the outcomes of certain treatments applied to plants. We would like to predict whether the plants survive based on the status of the plants and the treatments. The datafile can be downloaded from [here](assests/datasets/plants.xlsx).\n\nWe could use the following code to read the data.\n\n::: {#9d338c65 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_excel('assests/datasets/plants.xlsx', engine='openpyxl', sheet_name='data')\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are a few missing values. The missing values in `Outcome_after 12 months` are all `dead`. These are not recorded as `dead` because the cause of the death is more complicated and needs to be studied separatedly. In our case we could simply fill it with `dead`.\n\nThere are two more missing values in `Stem diameter`. For simplicity we drop them directly.\n\n::: {#e9ff3613 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf['Outcome_after 12 months'].fillna('dead', inplace=True)\ndf = df.dropna()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we would like to transform the data. Here are the rules. \n\n- `Endophyte`: `I+`->`1`, `I-`->`-1`\n- `Treatment`: `Salt`->`1`, `Fresh`->`0`\n- `Tree_Replicate`: `T1`->`1`, `T2`->`2`, `T3`->`3`\n- `Outcome_after 12 months`: `survived`->`1`, `dead`->0\n\nColumn `SN` will be dropped. \n\nFinally we put these together to get the features `X` and the label `y`.\n\n::: {#8214c04a .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf['Endophyte '] = df['Endophyte '].map({'I+': 1, 'I-': -1})\ndf['Treatment'] = df['Treatment'].map({'Fresh': 0, 'Salt': 1})\ndf['Tree_Replicate'] = df['Tree_Replicate'].str[1].astype(int)\ndf['Outcome_after 12 months'] = df['Outcome_after 12 months'].map({'survived': 1, 'dead': 0})\n\nX = df.iloc[:, 1: -1].to_numpy()\ny = df['Outcome_after 12 months'].to_numpy()\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
